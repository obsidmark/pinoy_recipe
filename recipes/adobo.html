            <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>Add onion and garlic to the skillet; cook until softened and brown, about 6 minutes. Pour in soy sauce and vinegar and season with garlic powder, black pepper, and bay leaf.

            <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>Return chicken to pan, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is tender and cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes.</p>
